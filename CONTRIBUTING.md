## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment. Please be kind and constructive in all interactions.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hytale-server-docker.git
   cd hytale-server-docker
   ```
3. **Add the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/ivanjx/hytale-server-docker.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Docker 20.10+ with BuildKit enabled
- Docker Compose v2
- Bash shell
- `jq` and `curl` for running authentication scripts

### Local Development

1. **Create a `.env` file** with your configuration:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your settings
   ```

2. **Build the image locally**:

   docker-compose -f docker-compose.build.yml build
   ```

3. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.build.yml up
   ```

### Testing Multi-Architecture Builds

```bash
# Create a buildx builder
docker buildx create --name multiarch --use

# Build for multiple platforms (without pushing)
docker buildx build \
  --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 \
  --build-arg HYTALE_CREDENTIALS="${HYTALE_CREDENTIALS}" \
  -t hytale-server:test \
  .
```
